== Introduction ==

WikiXRay is a Python application aimed to automate the analysis of Wikipedia 
database dumps. It was originally created to support the analysis performed
in Felipe Ortega's PhD. thesis "Wikipedia: A quantitative analysis". This was
the first research work to undertake a side-by-side comparison, from a
quantitative perspective, of the top-ten Wikipedias (according to their
number of encyclopedic articles).

Right now, it is mostly a collection of scripts to perform each individual
analysis included in this work, and other subsequent studies. It is intended
to evolve into a fully functional tool that will offer a comprehensive and
easy to use framework to automate the analysis of any Wikipedia version.

Currently, WikiXRay includes the following features:

 - SAX parsers to import information from Wikipedia database dumps. It
   supports the following dump files:
   
     - pages-meta-history.xml.7z: Full dump of complete revision history for 
       all pages.

     - pages-logging.xml.gz: Dump of logged actions (blocks, deletions,
       flagged revisions, etc.).

 - Article analysis: authorship, content, evolution.
 - Editorial work: number of editors, effort trends, evolution.
 - Survival analysis: community size, number of active editors.
 - Featured Articles: content, size, editors, evolution.
 - Inequality analysis of: editors contributions, edits in articles,
   evolution.
